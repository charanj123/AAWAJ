🎙️ AI Dubbing System
The AI Dubbing System is an end-to-end pipeline that automates the process of dubbing videos into different languages using advanced AI techniques. It leverages speech recognition, language translation, voice cloning, and speech synthesis to deliver natural and synchronized dubbed audio for any video.

🔧 Features
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) – Transcribes the original video/audio using models like Whisper or DeepSpeech.

Language Translation – Translates the transcript into a target language using transformers (e.g., M2M100, MarianMT).

Voice Cloning & TTS – Reconstructs the speaker's voice in the target language using models like Coqui TTS or Bark.

Audio-Video Synchronization – Ensures the generated voice aligns with the original video timings.

Multi-language Support – Easily customizable for any language pair.

User Interface (Optional) – Streamlit or web interface to upload videos and preview results.
